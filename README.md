# RAG Application
An Application leveraging Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide precise, context-aware answers. This project integrates advanced LLMs, vector stores and LangChain frameworks to enhance information retrieval and user interaction.

## Features
- Efficient Data Indexing: Preprocesses and indexes large unstructured datasets for seamless retrieval.
- Contextual Retrieval: Retrieves the most relevant document chunks using semantic search and metadata filtering.
- Dynamic Answer Generation: Generates concise and accurate answers using GPT-4.
- Streamlined Workflow: Orchestrates application logic with LangGraph for smooth multi-step operations.

## Tech Stack
- Core Tools: LangChain, LangGraph, LangSmith
- Models: OpenAI GPT-4 and Embedding Models
- Vector Storage: MemoryVectorStore with options for expansion to scalable solutions

## Key Functionalities
- Data Indexing: Loads, splits, and stores document chunks to enable efficient retrieval.
- Question-Answering: Combines user queries with retrieved context to deliver insightful answers.
- Optimized Query Processing: Includes query analysis to improve retrieval accuracy and efficiency.

## Project Structure
- The project is modularly structured, with separate components for data loading, text splitting, embeddings, vector store operations, and prompt handling.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement conversational capabilities for multi-step interactions.
- Expand vector storage to scalable solutions like Pinecone or Qdrant.
- Incorporate chat history to enrich context awareness.

## Contributing
- Contributions are welcome! Feel free to propose ideas, report issues, or submit pull requests.
